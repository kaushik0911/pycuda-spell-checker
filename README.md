## Automatic Spelling Mistake Corrector ##
Word spell checking is well researching area in natural language processing. It deals with spelling error detecting and automatic correcting of errors in an electronic word (text) document. Auto correcting are widely applicable for tasks like word-processing and post-processing.
There are several approaches to spelling correction have been discovered in the literature, use rule-based, dictionary-based, statistical, etc. 

Problem domain 
---------
To autocorrect large text document, take several processing techniques and considerable amount of time. Because need to check each and every word in the document and if need to correct word, must correct. In word processing software shows misspelled word but user need to correct it manually by selecting correct word from given set of words. 

**Technologies**
